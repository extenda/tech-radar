description: |
  Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning infrastructure
  (machines, data-centers) through definition files, rather than physical,
  manual configuration or using interactive tools. IaC is essential to automating
  infrastructure configuration.
rationale: |
  Treat your infrastructure as code and automate creating it and destroying it.
  This becomes especially important in a cloud-environment.
