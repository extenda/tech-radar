  Kubernetes is a tool that enhances the capabilities of containers to create an easy configurable
  environment with scalability. This will allow for automatic processing such as CI/CD pipelines
  and noOps environments.
  Kubernetes is mainly used for cloud functionality there is however a local version
  called "Minikube" useful for testing Kubernetes locally.
rationale: |
  As a lot of development is progressing towards micro-services Kubernetes goes hand
  in hand towards this goal. successfully configuring Kubernetes with microservices
  would lead to near 100% uptime with lots of automatic functionality and therefore
  reducing resources needed for maintaining the up status of an organizations services.

  By leveraging Google Cloud we can use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to run or masters.
  This will reduce the amount of time that we need to use managing a cluster by ourselves.
  GKE runs Google Compute Engine instances for your cluster and has the master as a service.
