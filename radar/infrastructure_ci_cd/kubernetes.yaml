description: |
  Kubernetes is a tool that enhances the capabilities of containers to create an easy configurable
  environment with scalability. This will allow for automatic processing such as CI/CD pipelines
  and noOps environments.
  Kubernetes is mainly used for cloud functionality there is however a local version
  called "Minikube" useful for testing Kubernetes locally.
rationale: |
  As a lot of development is progressing towards micro-services Kubernetes goes hand
  in hand towards this goal. successfully configuring Kubernetes with microservices
  would lead to near 100% uptime with lots of automatic functionality and therefore
  reducing resources needed for maintaining the up status of an organizations services.
