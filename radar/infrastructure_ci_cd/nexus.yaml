  Extenda Retail is operating a public Nexus repository. It is used by our development teams for private packages
  for Maven/Gradle, NuGet, NPM and RPMs.

  All developers have read access and writes are restricted to our CI service accounts. Details on how to configure
  and use Nexus are found on our
  [internal Confluence page](https://confluence.extendaretail.com/display/BT/Nexus+Repository+Manager).
