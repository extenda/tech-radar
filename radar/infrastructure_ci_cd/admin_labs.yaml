  [AdminLabs](https://www.adminlabs.com/status-page/) is a tool to check status of services,
  share incident, and maintenance details over internet available to our employees, customers and their stake holders.
rationale: |
  Use AdminLabs to check status of services ( Hii retail, Relevate and Platoform).
  The AdminLabs pings the health check url of the services and reports back status as
  Operation, Outage or Under Maintenance.
  We are assessing the following:
  * Status Page
  * Incident notification
  * Maintenance details
  * Status subscription
  * How easy is setup
  * How to configure status page for Hii retail services, Relevate per customer and Platform services
  * more details for the assessment available at
