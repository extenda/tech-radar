  [Zed Attach Proxy (ZAP)](https://www.zaproxy.org/) is a web app scanner to discover vulnerabilities in APIs.
rationale: |
  We're assessing ZAP as a tool to automate vulnerability scanning of APIs and services. We hope that this,
  in addition to our other tooling around security (such as SonarCloud and Trivy), can give teams good insights
  into their areas to improve as well as inherited vulnerabilities (from dependencies).
