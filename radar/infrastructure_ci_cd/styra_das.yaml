description: |
  [Styra DAS](https://www.styra.com/manage-open-policy-agent-with-styra-das) is a SaaS management and
  control plane for Open Policy Agent (OPA).
rationale: |
  Styra's Declarative Authorization Service (DAS) is a system to manage our OPA enabled services. It can load
  service policies from GitHub, supports stack and libraries for policy reuse and differentiates between
  ingress (Envoy integration) and application (service integration) policy declarations.

  We've adopted Styra DAS to help us succeed in these areas:

    * Managing policy-as-code as part of an established GitOps process
    * Validating the impact of policy changes before committing or deploying
    * Distributing policy across a large number of OPAs running on multiple K8S clusters
    * Monitoring authorization decisions in real time, and historically, to ensure policy works as expected
