  [Styra DAS](https://www.styra.com/manage-open-policy-agent-with-styra-das) is a SaaS management and
  control plane for Open Policy Agent (OPA).
rationale: |
  Styra's Declarative Authorization Service (DAS) is a system to manage our OPA enabled services. It can load
  service policies from GitHub, supports stack and libraries for policy reuse and differentiates between
  ingress (Envoy integration) and application (service integration) policy declarations.

  The main things we're assessing are:

    * Styra DAS as a control plane for our OPA services
    * Styra DAS as our data bundle server to avoid building a highly-available bundle server ourselves.
      With Styra, we only need to build a smaller integration layer between our IAM and Styra DAS
    * How Styra DAS can be used to author policies interactively to see how the changes affect previous
      decision logs
    * How Styra DAS can help us in unit testing our service policies, both interactively and from CI/CD
