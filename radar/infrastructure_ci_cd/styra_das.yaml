  [Styra DAS](https://www.styra.com/manage-open-policy-agent-with-styra-das) is a SaaS management and
  control plane for Open Policy Agent (OPA).
rationale: |
  Styra's Declarative Authorization Service (DAS) is a system to manage our OPA enabled services. It can load
  service policies from GitHub, supports stack and libraries for policy reuse and differentiates between
  ingress (Envoy integration) and application (service integration) policy declarations.

  We're looking at Styra DAS because it acts both as a control plane and as a data bundle server for our
  OPA services. If we where to use Styra DAS, we don't need to build a highly-available bundle server
  by ourselves, and can instead build a smaller service to ingest IAM data as data bundles in Styra DAS.

  Another potential we see with Styra DAS is it's ability to interactively work on policies and see how a
  change affects already executed decisions. It also includes unit testing capabilities which we hope
  to be able to utilize both interactively and from CI/CD workflows.
