description: |
  [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) is a high availability load balancer and proxy server
  for TCP and HTTP-based applications that spreads requests across multiple servers.
rationale:
  We need to look into reverse proxies and load balancers.
  The product/service should be easy to setup and use regardless of k8s or Docker.
