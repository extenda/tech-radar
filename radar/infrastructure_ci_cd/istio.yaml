  Cloud platforms provide a wealth of benefits for the organizations that use them.
  However, thereâ€™s no denying that adopting the cloud can put strains on DevOps teams.
  Developers must use microservices to architect for portability,
  meanwhile operators are managing extremely large hybrid and multi-cloud deployments.
  Istio lets you connect, secure, control, and observe services.
rationale: |
  To be able to achieve speed in development we need to reduce time spent on common resources for each microservice.
  By using Istio we can spend less time on infrastructure and more time on business logic.
