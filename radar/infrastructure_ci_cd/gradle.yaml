  Gradle is a build system and dependency manager for JVM languages such as Java, Groovy and Android.
  The main differentiator when compared to Apache Maven is that it's configured with Groovy instead of XML.
  This allows for _very flexible_ build systems.
rationale:
  Extenda Retail is invested in Apache Maven as the preferred build system for
  JVM languages. Our development processes and CI pipelines are targeted at
  Apache Maven and not Gradle.

  Don't use Gradle simply because the team prefers it over the alternatives.
  To use Gradle, make sure to _really motivate_ why it is a better fit. A good
  example where it _is_ a better fit is Android, because the Google preferred
  build platform for Android is Gradle.
