  GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and
  deploy your code right from GitHub.
rationale: |
  Github Actions support CI on a variety of build platforms including Windows, MacOS and Linux. You have the option to
  build in pre-built containers, bring your own, or build on VMs. There already exists an enormous collection of
  community actions to move quickly with intergrating with 3rd party sevices. The pricing model is highly competitive,
  and would allow us to significantly reduce our spend compared to CircleCI or Appveyor. It is CI as a Service, which is
  the direction we want to move.
