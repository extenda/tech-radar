  GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and
  deploy your code right from GitHub.
rationale: |
  GitHub Actions support CI on a variety of build platforms including Windows, MacOS and Linux. You have the option to
  build in pre-built containers, bring your own, or build on VMs. There already exists an enormous collection of
  community actions to move quickly with integrating with 3rd party services. The pricing model is highly competitive,
  and would allow us to significantly reduce our spend compared to CircleCI or Appveyor. It is CI as a Service, which is
  the direction we want to move.

  GitHub Actions gives an easy way to handle pipelines with its seamless way of handling CI pipelines.
  Using GitHub Actions is recommended because it reduces the time developers need to think about pipelines
  and therefore increase our effort on our core products.

  Use GitHub Actions for all new development. Builds on GitHub Actions should generally complete within
  15 minutes. GitHub Actions is also heavily geared towards continuous delivery to the cloud.

  These are the advices for other CI/CD platforms:
    * Do not migrate from Jenkins AWS. The exception would be fast builds with a continuous delivery requirement
    * CircleCI pipelines should be migrated to GitHub Actions
    * AppVeyor pipelines should be migrated to GitHub Actions
    * TeamCity pipelines should be migrated to GitHub Actions
