description: |
  TeamCity is a Java-based build management and continuous integration server from JetBrains.
  It was first released on October 2, 2006.
  TeamCity is commercial software and licensed under a proprietary license.
  A Freemium license for up to 100 build configurations and 3 free Build Agent licenses is available.
rationale:
  Every team should have responsibility for their own builds and it should be easy to use from a UI.
  We found the TeamCity UI better than Jenkins
