  enables us to centrally store artifacts and
  build dependencies as part of an integrated Google Cloud experience.
  A universal package manager for all our build artifacts and dependencies.
  Fast, scalable, reliable and secure.
  Supports Docker, Maven, Gradle & npm
rationale: |
  We should Assess whetever this is a suitable candidate to centralize all our dependencies.
  Since the product is still in BETA we should be careful to utilize this in any production env.

  What we need to assess:
    * Easy of use
    * Available documentation
    * Pricing
    * Migration effort
