  [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/architecture) is a fully-managed real-time messaging service.
  That allows you to send and receive messages between independent applications.

  By providing many-to-many, asynchronous messaging that decouples senders and receivers,
  it allows for secure and highly available communication among independently written applications.
rationale: |
  Pub/Sub brings the flexibility and reliability of enterprise messaging to Extenda Retail.
  It will provide us with a scalable, durable event ingestion and delivery system.
  This will make sure that we have a good foundation for building modern messaging pipelines.
  For developers Cloud Pub/Sub delivers low-latency, durable messaging that can quickly be integrated with other systems
  hosted on the Google Cloud Platform and external sources.

      The service is provided and managed by Google Cloud.
      This means that the cost and need for involvement on an operational level is eliminated.
      Instead we pay a premium on service usage instead.

      the system stays up and running efficiently with no worries about uptime,
