description: |
  Cake (C# Make) is a cross-platform build automation system with a C# DSL for tasks such as compiling code, copying
  files and folders, running unit tests, compressing files and building NuGet packages.
rationale: |
  Regardless if you're building on your own machine, or building on a CI system, Cake is built to behave in the same
  way. Cake supports the most common tools used during builds such as MSBuild, .NET Core CLI, MSTest, xUnit, NUnit,
  NuGet, ILMerge, WiX and SignTool out of the box.
