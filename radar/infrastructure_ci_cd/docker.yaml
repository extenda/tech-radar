  Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications
  by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with
  all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all
  out as one package.
rationale: |
  We see many usages for Docker. As we're entering the cloud, we need to explore
  it for production. The other primary focus so far has been to use Docker for
  self-contained exploratory testing.
