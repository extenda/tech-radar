description: |
  Buildpacks is a Cloud Native Sandbox project. It embraces modern container standards, such as OCI image format,
  to build the most optimized Docker image to be deployed to any Cloud.
  It provides a simple CLI tool, Pack, to try it out.
rationale: |
  By using Buildpacks, we ensure that our apps meet security and compliance requirements and that
  the built image is optimized for running in our Cloud environment.
  There is also no need to define a Dockerfile and having to learn the syntax and process how to create a
  optimized, production ready Docker image.
