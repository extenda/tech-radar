  Open Policy Agent
rationale: |
  As the technology landscape is becoming more complex, concerns such as security need more automation and engineering
  practices. When building systems, we need to take into consideration security policies, which are rules and procedures
  to protect our systems from threats and disruption. For example, access control policies define and enforce who can
  access which services and resources under what circumstances; by contrast, network security policies can dynamically
  limit the traffic rate to a particular service.

  The Open Policy Agent (OPA, pronounced “oh-pa”) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies
  policy enforcement across the stack. OPA provides a high-level declarative language that let’s you specify
  policy as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from your software. You can use OPA to
  enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more.
