  Open Policy Agent
rationale: |
  The Open Policy Agent (OPA, pronounced “oh-pa”) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies
  policy enforcement across the stack. OPA provides a high-level declarative language that let’s you specify
  policy as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from your software. You can use OPA to
  enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more.
