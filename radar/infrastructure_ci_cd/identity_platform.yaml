  Google Cloud's Identity Platform is a fully managed user authentication solution that supports
  multi-tenancy, local e-mail users and federated login over OpenID Connect, SAML as well as
  multiple social providers.
rationale: |
  Identity Platform is the SaaS we're using for user identity and authentication. It will help us support
  authentication in a multi-tenancy setup with different login providers for each tenant.

  We can manage Identity Platform with Terraform, which allows us to automate tenant creation and configuration.

  Clients use [Firebase UI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui) to add sign-in support in the
  application. Once authenticated, the platform returns an ID token which contains user information and can be
  used for communicating with the Hii Retail services. Our Identity and Access Management will use the
  [Firebase Admin SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup) to add custom claims to JWTs.

  The JWT from Identity Platform can be used with Open Policy Agent (OPA) to authorize the user.
