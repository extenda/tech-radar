  [ORY Hyrda](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/) OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Certified OpenID Connect Server.
rationale: |
  ORY Hydra is a fully compiant OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect Server. We plan to utilize Hydra to support the OAuth Client
  Credential Flow which is not currently supported by Google Identity Platform. The Client Credential Flow is used to
  enable machine authentication, where a client_id and client_secret are exchanged for a signed JWT which is used for
  authentication to Extenda Retail APIs. Things that we want to assess are as follows

    * Ease of Deployment
    * Scalability
    * Performance
    * High Availability
    * Security
