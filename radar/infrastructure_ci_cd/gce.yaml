  Google Compute Engine (GCE) is the Infrastructure as a Service component of Google Cloud Platform.
  Google Compute Engine enables users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand.
rationale: |
  We should avoid building software that depends on virtual machines.
  It is OK to launch VMs to perform one off tasks, but it shouldn't be part of the final product.
  Preferably look for better options such as:

    * Docker images on GKE
    * Serverless functions
    * SaaS solutions.
