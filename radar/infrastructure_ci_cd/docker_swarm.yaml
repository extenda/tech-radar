  [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) is a clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers.
  With Swarm, IT administrators and developers can establish and manage a cluster of Docker nodes
  as a single virtual system.
rationale:
  We want all services and APIs to be containerized,
  if the containers can run in k8s they should in theory also be able to run in Docker Swarm
