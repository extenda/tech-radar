description: |
  [VerneMQ](https://vernemq.com) is first and foremost a MQTT publish/subscribe message broker which
  implements the OASIS industry standard MQTT protocol. But VerneMQ is also built to take messaging and IoT
  applications to the next level by providing a unique set of features related to scalability, reliability
  and high-performance as well as operational simplicity.
rationale: |
  We communicate with peripherals with the lightweight MQTT protocol and need a message broker that handles that.
  VerneMQ is low cost alternative to Google Cloud IoT that is the GCP option.

  Some interesting feature of VerneMQ to assess:
    * Cluster support
    * Bridge support
    * Multi-tenancy through different mount points in the topic tree
