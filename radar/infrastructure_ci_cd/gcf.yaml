  Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services.
  With Cloud Functions you write functions that are attached to events emitted from your infrastructure and services.
  Your Cloud Function is triggered when an event being watched is fired.
rationale: |
  Serverless functions removes the nontrivial effort that goes into server and OS configuration and orchestration.
  These systems cost very little to operate and have inbuilt scaling features.
  While serverless architectures have significant benefits, there are drawbacks too:

    * Deploying
    * Managing and sharing code across services is more complex
    * local or offline testing is more difficult if not impossible.
