  Cloud Run is a servless compute platform on Google Cloud Platform that automatically scales your stateless containers.
  Cloud Run is built on top of Knative and Kubernetes and abstract away most of the complexity to allow development
  teams to deliver stateless containers.
rationale: |
  Cloud Run reduces the cognitive load that is introduced by Kubernetes and Knative. It allows the development teams
  to focus on the application. To use Cloud Run, you must containerize your application, keep it stateless and write
  it as an request/event-driven application.

  Cloud Run comes in two flavors:

    1. Fully-managed by Google
    2. On top of GKE with Knative

  With fully-managed Cloud Run there's no need for a GKE cluster and you pay for the compute time. The fully-managed
  solution comes with a few restrictions as that what GCP resources can be used and how deployment works. These
  restrictions will reduce over time and with the ease to migrate to Cloud Run on GKE, our approach is to start with
  fully-managed Cloud Run that we anticipate we eventually will migrate.

  Regardless whether fully-managed Cloud Run or GKE Cloud Run is used, developers will be able to use the same tools
  to deploy their containers.
