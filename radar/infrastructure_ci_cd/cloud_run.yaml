  Cloud Run is a servless compute platform on Google Cloud Platform that automatically scales your stateless containers.
  Cloud Run is built on top of Knative and Kubernetes and abstract away most of the complexity to allow development
  teams to deliver stateless containers.
rationale: |
  Cloud Run reduces the cognitive load that is introduced by Kubernetes and Knative. It allows the development teams
  to focus on the application. To use Cloud Run, you must containerize your application, keep it stateless and write
  it as an request/event-driven application.

  Cloud Run comes in two flavors:

    1. Fully-managed by Google
    2. Cloud Run for Anthos, running on GKE with Knative

  We have adopted Cloud Run for Anthos as this gives us a serverless compute platform from the developer perspective,
  but also supports the nobs we need to turn in the cloud native platform.

  With Cloud Run for Anthos, we support a continuous deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions, policy-based
  authorization with Open Policy Agent and integrated metrics and monitoring with Cloud Operations.
