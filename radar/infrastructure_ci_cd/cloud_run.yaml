description: |
  Cloud Run is a serverless compute platform on Google Cloud Platform that automatically scales your
  stateless containers.
rationale: |
  Cloud Run reduces the cognitive load that is introduced by Kubernetes and Knative. It allows the development teams
  to focus on the application. To use Cloud Run, you must containerize your application, keep it stateless and write
  it as an request/event-driven application.

  With Cloud Run, we support a continuous deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions, policy-based
  authorization with Open Policy Agent and integrated metrics and monitoring with Cloud Operations.
