description: |
  Jib builds optimized Docker and OCI images for your Java applications without a Docker daemon.
  It is available as plugins for Maven and Gradle and as a Java library.
  Jib separates your application into multiple layers, splitting dependencies from classes.
rationale: |
  With Jib we dont need to rebuild the whole Java application only the layers that changed.
  Also we don't need a specific Dockerfiles meaning one less syntax to learn and handle.
  On top of that the image produced is a distroless image which means that we get a minimal image.
