  A centralized, SaaS solution for Identity and Access Management (IAM) is necessary
  to efficiently secure services in the public cloud.
rationale: |
  Extenda Retail is actively assessing SaaS solutions to the IAM problem. We need
  a provider that supports federated user authentication and an efficient way
  to secure machine to API communication. Our requirements include:

    * Federated authentication for ADFS and social
    * Single sign on
    * API user tokens for CLI integrations

  We are evaluating [Auth0](https://auth0.com), but are currently struggling with
  a way to support API user tokens of some sort.

  ### Authentication - Not Authorization

  To make it clear, Extenda Retail's goal is to find a SaaS solution to
  authentication, *not* authorization. The idea is that the authentication SaaS
  provides a JWT containing the user with active roles for the application.
  The application is then free to evaulate these roles against its internal set
  of permissions.
