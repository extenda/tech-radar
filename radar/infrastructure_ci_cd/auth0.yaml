  [Auth0](https://auth0.com) is a SaaS for user and machine-machine authentication. It supports local users and
  federated login over social, Open ID, ADFS and SAML.
rationale: |
  Auth0 has been assessed as a potential SaaS supplier for our authentication needs. The following reasons
  where the main drivers for looking into Auth0

    * Leading authentication SaaS
    * Both user and machine-machine authentication
    * Strong documentation

  After our decision to prefer Google services, we've opted to not use Auth0. Main reasons for this are:

    * Not a Google service
    * Problematic pricing model for large amounts of users and/or machines
    * No official Terraform provider to manage tenants and applications/clients

      Auth0 requires a license. We currently have a legacy developer license, in use by a few clients to
      perform machine-to-machine authentication using the client credentials grant oauth2 flow.
