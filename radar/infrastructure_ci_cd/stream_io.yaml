  [Stream](https://getstream.io/) enables us to build chat/feeds/push message functionality
  without implementing backend and transport. It has stylable components for 
  React, React Native, Flutter, IOS and Android. This can be used for ex. in-store chat, 
  order feeds, alerts, assigning tasks to staff using bots and other integrations, possibility
  for chat between store staff and end users.

  Features:
  * Multi-tenancy
  * Giphy, emoticons and File Attachments
  * Threads
  * Direct and Group Chats
  * Link previews help users share information
  * Search your messages & conversations
  * Bot automation and forms
  * Custom message types
rationale: |
  We should assess if this can be a suitable candidate for a chat/feeds backend.
  
  What we need to assess:
  * Pricing beyond standard tier
  * Authentication
  * Ease of use
  * Language support
  * Chat bot implementations
  * Flutter components
