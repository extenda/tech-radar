  This blip contains the common services that we can use within GCP.
  Services deemed to be core services:

    * VPC network
    * Network services
    * Container Registry
    * Storage
    * Network Security
    * IAM & Admin
rationale: |
  Since we have chosen to go with Google Cloud,
  This blip represent all services that are considered to be part of the core package for GCP.
  Therefore all the services gathered here are consolidated into a single blip for brevity.
