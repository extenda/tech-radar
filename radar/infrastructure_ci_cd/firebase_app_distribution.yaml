  [Firebase App Distribution](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution) enables distributing mobile apps
  to trusted testers
rationale: |
  It would allow us to extend our CI/CD pipeline with distributing our mobile apps variants(e.g. staging),
  as on Android Play or Apple Testflight one can only upload one build variant(i.e. production)

  We should asses how easy and convenient is to distribute builds through Firebase
  contrary to AppCenter being that Firebase Distribution comes for free with the GCP.

  The scope of this blip is Firebase App Distribution vs AppCenter Distribution hence it wont
  put on hold AppCenter as per se.
