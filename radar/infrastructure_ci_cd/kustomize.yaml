description: |
  Kustomize introduces a template-free way to customize application configuration for Kubernetes.
  Simplifies the use of off-the-shelf applications.
  Built into kubectl as apply -k and as a template engine in Spinnaker.
rationale: |
  With Kustomize we can reduce the amount of boilerplate code and adhere to the DRY principal.
  Kustomize has been adopted by the Kubernetes project and is built-in into the CLI.
  Since it is built in we should use it before other tools such as Helm for templating.
