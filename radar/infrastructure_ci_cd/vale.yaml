  [Vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale) is a command-line tool that brings code-like linting to prose.
  It's fast, cross-platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux), and highly customizable.
  Vale is also available as a GitHub Action.
rationale: |
  Vale allows us to lint natural language.
  
  Through the possibility to create Extenda specific styles, we can customize what's considered errors, 
  warnings, or suggestions. [Vale-Studio](https://vale-studio.errata.ai/) is a tool for developing such writing rules.
  The community around Vale also makes officially maintained styles available for download to be used as-is or as part of a custom style.
  
  Vale also has a concept about custom vocabularies. These allow you to maintain custom lists of terminology independent of your styles.
  
  Since Vale is available as both a CLI and GitHub action, we can, with some configuration, 
  create commit hooks that will run Vale in development environments before we push changes. 
  
  [Vale-Server](https://errata.ai/vale-server/) (a cross-platform desktop application) looks like a good non-developer alternative to the CLI. 
  However, there is a monthly license cost attached to this alternative.
