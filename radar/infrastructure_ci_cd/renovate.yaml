  [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate). Automated dependency updates. Multi-platform and multi-language.
rationale:
  We want a tool that can simplify dependency updates by grouping update PRs.
  
  Renovate can group dependency update by monorepo (e.g. @nestjs/*),
  by type (e.g. all non-major versions).

  It supports a lot of configuration options and can be used instead of [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot).
