  [Cloud FireStore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) Cloud Firestore is a flexible, 
  scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform. 
  Like Firebase Realtime Database, it keeps your data in sync across client apps through realtime listeners and offers 
  offline support for mobile and web so you can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or 
  Internet connectivity. Cloud Firestore also offers seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform
  products, including Cloud Functions.

  individual, specific documents or to retrieve all the documents in a collection that match your query parameters.

  actively using, so the app can write, read, listen to, and query data even if the device is offline.
  Cloud Firestore brings you the best of Google Cloud Platform's powerful infrastructure: automatic multi-region 
  data replication, strong consistency guarantees,
