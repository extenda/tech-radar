description: |
  [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability scanner
  for containers and other artifacts, suitable for CI.
rationale: |
  Trivy allows to detect vulnerabilities in **OS packages**
  (Alpine, Red Hat Universal Base Image, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux,
  openSUSE Leap, SUSE Enterprise Linux, Photon OS and Distroless)
  and **Application dependencies** (Bundler, Composer, Pipenv, Poetry, npm, yarn, Cargo and NuGet).

  It is very fast and has almost the same sthength as GCP Container Registry Scanning service,
  but it's totaly free of charge.
