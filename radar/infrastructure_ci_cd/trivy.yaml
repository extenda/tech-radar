description: |
  [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability scanner
  for containers and other artifacts, suitable for CI.
rationale: |
  Trivy allows to detect vulnerabilities in **OS packages**
  (Alpine, Red Hat Universal Base Image, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux,
  openSUSE Leap, SUSE Enterprise Linux, Photon OS and Distroless)
  and **Application dependencies** (Bundler, Composer, Pipenv, Poetry, npm, yarn, Cargo and NuGet).

  It is very fast and has almost the same detecting power as GCP Container Registry Scanning service,
  but it's totaly free of charge.
  Tested with *vulnerables/web-dvwa* vulnerable image, trivy found 391 CVEs, (CRG found 399 CVEs).

  To integrate in workflow the [trivy-action](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action) can be used. The good startpoint
  is to alert only CRITICAL and HIGH severity vulnerabilities, and ignore vulnerabilities which don't have fixes.

  False-positives can be eliminated by adding CVE to `.trityigrnore` file in the root of the repository.
  However before adding CVE to ignored list ensure that:

    * target image uses the latest version of the base OS image
    * application dependencies have latest versions of used libraries
