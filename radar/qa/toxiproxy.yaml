description: |
  [Toxiproxy](https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy) is a framework for simulation network conditions.
  It can be used for chaos engineering to simulate latency, downtime and unreliable networking towards dependencies.
rationale: |
  Toxiproxy is an interesting tool for use during development and staging to help development teams understand
  how their system behaves when dependencies become unavailable or unstable. In a distributed microservice
  system we cannot count on all things always being up and available.
