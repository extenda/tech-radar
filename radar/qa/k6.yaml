description: |
  [k6](https://k6.io/) is a modern open-source load testing tool written in Go and executes scripts written in
  Javascript. Outputing the result can be done to a number of products such as Kafka, Datadog and InfluxDB.
rationale: |
  By using k6 we can easily identify performance issues early in development by "shifting left" and integrating it with
  our CI pipeline, making it an ideal tool for our new services and products.

  Adding Checks and Thresholds as pass/fail criterias to our scripts will get us quick feedback when we do changes.
