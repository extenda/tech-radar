description: |
  [k6](https://k6.io/) is a modern open-source load testing tool written in Go and executes scripts written in Javascript.
rationale: |
  By using k6 we can easily identify performance issues early in development by "shifting left" and integrating it with
  our CI pipeline, making it an ideal tool for our new services and products.

  Checks and thresholds can be added to the scripts as pass/fail criterias along with outputing the result to a number
  of products such as Kafka, Datadog and InfluxDB to mention a few. They also have a SaaS product running in the Cloud.
