description: |
  [Architectural Decision Records (ADR)](https://adr.github.io/) captures
  a single Architecutral Decision and together forms a decision log.
rationale: |
  We use ADR as a way to document decisions taken related to architecture and technology.
  The main rationale for doing this is that its an easy and common way to follow decisions
  and see the rationale behind that specific decision.

  Architectural Decision Records follows this syntax:
  ````
  In the context of <use case/user story u>,
  facing <concern c> we decided for <option o>
  and neglected <other options>,
  to achieve <system qualities/desired consequences>,
  accepting <downside d/undesired consequences>,
  because <additional rationale>.
  ````

  We recommend using the [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) utility to create and maintain
  ADRs in your GitHub repository.
