  [Architectural Decision Records (ADR)](https://adr.github.io/) captures
  a single Architecutral Decision and together forms a decision log.
rationale: |
  We should assess if ADR is a good way for us to document decisions taken.
  The main rationale is that its an easy and common way to follow decisions
  and see the rationale behind that specific decision.

  An Architectural Decision Records follows this syntax:
  ````
  In the context of <use case/user story u>,
  facing <concern c> we decided for <option o>
  and neglected <other options>,
  to achieve <system qualities/desired consequences>,
  accepting <downside d/undesired consequences>,
  because <additional rationale>.
