description: |
  [Architectural Decision Records (ADR)](https://adr.github.io/) captures
  a single Architectural Decision and together forms a decision log.
rationale: |
  We use ADR as a way to document decisions taken related to architecture and technology.
  The main rationale for doing this is that its an easy and common way to follow decisions
  and see the rationale behind that specific decision.

  We should use the [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) utility to create and maintain
  ADRs in your GitHub repository. We have wrapped the tool in
  [docker-adr-tools](https://github.com/extenda/docker-adr-tools) to make it easily accessible on all platforms.
