  [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/docs/overview/what-is-tracing/) is not a download or a program.
  Distributed tracing requires that software developers add instrumentation to the code of an application,
  or to the frameworks used in the application. OpenTracing is not a standard.
rationale:
  IT and DevOps teams can use distributed tracing to monitor applications.
  Distributed tracing is particularly well-suited to debugging and monitoring modern distributed
  software architectures, such as microservices.
  Developers can use distributed tracing to help debug and optimize their code.
