  [App Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/) cloud solution covers cross platform building, testing,
  distributing, anaylitcs, crash reporting and application push notification.
rationale: |
  We believe that for Xamarin.Forms based mobile applications the MS Visual Studio
  App Center testcloud would be the way to go for UI test automation using Xamarin.UITest framework.
  It would allow us extend our CI/CD pipeline with our current competencies and staffing to running
  automated tests in the cloud using physical devices on all Android / iOS versions we officially
  support. Nightly testing and reporting on code checked in during the day, and running automated
  regression testing weekly. Possibility of digging deeper into the deployment, analytics and
  crash reporting at a later stage.

      Parts of the solution is free (like distribution, analytics and crash reporting), but there is a cost of
      99 USD/month per device concurrency (= 30 device hours) for cloud testing.
