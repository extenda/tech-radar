description: |
  Pact is a contract testing tool to implement [consumer-driven contract testing](consumer_contract_testing.html).
rationale: |
  Pact is useful to develop consumer-driven contract testing with a TDD approach.
  The contract (pact) is defined in unit tests on the client as a set of interactions
  of input parameters and expected responses. As tests are passed, a Pact JSON file is
  generated. This file should be shared with the provider which should use in integration
  tests to verify that its output matches the contract.

  Pact supports multiple languages and allows for different techology stacks for
  frontend and backend.

  Pact also includes a Pact Server that can be deployed as a way to share
  contracts between consumers and providers in CI pipeline. The Pact Server hosts
  versioned contracts to help determine if all participants around a contract are releasable.

  Pact can define contracts for both REST and messaging APIs.
