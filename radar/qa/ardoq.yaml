  Ardoq is a collaborative, easy-to-use and intuitive tool for documenting your projects,
  business processes, applications, services, infrastructure or anything else that you can document in a structured way.
rationale: |
  We have identified a gap within our technical documentation.
  Details of dependencies and architecture are low and process diagrams are either lacking or not updated.
  We need a tool that assists in capturing this information, with minimum effort and maximum value to an audience.
  As the organization is about to go into a huge phase of change on an architecture level
  we also need a tool that helps us keep track of the technical platform in real-time.
  Ardoq appears to cover both of these requirements.
  We will run a Proof of Concept on a real module of Retail Suite to see if the tool fits our working method
  and gives a good ROI.
