  Ardoq is a collaborative, easy-to-use and intuitive tool for documenting your projects,
  business processes, applications, services, infrastructure or anything else that you can document in a structured way.
rationale: |
  Details of dependencies and architecture are low, and process diagrams are either lacking or not updated.
  We needed a tool that assists in capturing this information, with minimum effort and maximum value to an audience.
  As the organization is about to go into a huge phase of change on an architecture level
  we also need a tool that helps us keep track of the technical platform in real-time.
  Ardoq covers both of these requirements.
