  [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com) is a feature toggle SaaS that makes it possible to release and rollback
  features immediately without a redeploy. The service supports user segmentation for targeted feature previews
  and A/B testing etc.
rationale: |
  LaunchDarkly allows us to implement the _Release on demand_ capability in the
  [SAF continuous delivery pipeline](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/continuous-delivery-pipeline/).

  > To support a business that wants to release on demand, features must be waiting and verified in production before
  > the business needs them. Therefore, it’s optimal to separate the deployment process from the release process so
  > that deployed changes move into the production environment in a manner that does not affect the behavior of the
  > current system. This gives the teams the ability to make smaller, incremental changes, which can be deployed to
  > production continually but are not released to end users until the time is right.
