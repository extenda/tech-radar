description: |
  Spring Cloud Contract is a framework to implement [consumer-driven contract testing](consumer_contract_testing.html)
  primarily in Spring Boot applications.
rationale: |
  Spring Cloud Contracts integrates with Spring Boot 2 making it fast and easy
  to get started with consumer-driven contract testing. API definitions are
  defined in Groovy or YAML and exposed through WireMock for client-side testing.
  Server-side (provider) tests can be automatically generated.

  Spring Cloud Contract can define contracts for both REST and messaging APIs.

  When compared to Pact, Spring Cloud Contract is more tightly coupled to JVM languages.
  It also lacks a way to share contract definitions in other ways than dependency
  management through a repository.
