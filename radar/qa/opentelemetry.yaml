description: |
  [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) is a set of APIs, libraries, agents and collectors to capture
  distributed traces and metrics from applications. They can be analyzed using Google Operations
  (Stackdriver), Prometheus, Jaeger and others.
rationale: |
  OpenTelemetry is a merge of OpenTracing and OpenCensus. In HiiRetail we use OpenTelemetry to record tracing
  metrics in our applications. The records are then captured by GCP Operations (formerly Stackdriver) where
  they can be analyzed. OpenTelemetry APIs exists for all our languages: C# (Dotnet), Java, Javascript, Python.

  Using OpenTelemetry means the APIs must be added to the service and traces must be defined for the
  metrics to capture. When deployed, these metrics will show up in Operations (Stackdriver) and can be analyzed
  there.
