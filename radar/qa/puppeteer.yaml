  Puppeteer is an automation library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium.
  Puppeteer runs headless by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.
rationale: |
  Puppeteer is a fast, modern alternative to tools like Selenium and Appium. If you only need to run end-to-end tests
  in Chrome, consider Puppeteer for its ease of use and stable APIs.

  Puppeteer really shines when used with [jest-puppeteer](https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer).
  The test library will handle waits for you and there's no need to manually delay async assertions.

  Puppeteer is developed by the Google Chrome team, which means it is always up to date with Chrome.
