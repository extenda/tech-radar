  [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl#readme) is a C4 model DSL that allows us to express our
  architecture diagrams as code.
rationale: |
  We need a consistent and uniform way to document architecture for our Hii Retail services. Without a
  common way to create diagrams, teams choose very different abstraction levels and visual style for
  their architecture diagrams, or choose to not create any diagrams at all.

  We have decided to use the [C4 model](https://c4model.com) to describe our microservice systems.
  We have also decided to create diagrams as code using the
  [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl#readme). Diagrams will be treated as code and live
  in GitHub. We want to avoid "yet another tool" (e.g. Lucidchart) where documents would exist.
  Assets (PNGs) generated from the model should also be commited to GitHub.

  With the adoption of Structurizr DSL we see the following consequences

    * We have introduced a [structurizr-to-png](https://github.com/extenda/structurizr-to-png#readme)
      tool to generate images from DSL files.
    * The diagrams as code approach will from now on ensure that all our architecture diagrams have
      the same look and feel.
    * We can still use other tools for diagrams that are not C4. This decision has no immediate
      impact on tools like Lucidchart, but they should not be used for C4 anymore.
