  [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com) is both a set of APIs and a SaaS that allows generating
  [C4 diagrams](https://c4model.com) from code models.
rationale: |
  We should assess if C4 models are easier to maintain and create from code, rather than using
  diagramming tools such as LucidChart.

  To create diagrams, use the API implementation for your language
    * [structurizr-java](https://github.com/structurizr/java)
    * [structurizr-dotnet](https://github.com/structurizr/dotnet)

  Things we wish to assess:
    * Are the APIs for Java and Dotnet easier or more productive to use than LucidChart?
    * Is PlantUML output good enough for our needs?
    * Do we want to use the APIs with a Structurizr SaaS license to render diagrams in cloud?

      Graphviz or PlantUML.
