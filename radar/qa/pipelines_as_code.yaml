description: |
  _Pipelines as code_ is defining the build and deployment pipeline through
  code instead of using the CI/CD tool's interface. Examples of systems with
  this functionality include:
    - Jenkins CI
    - CircleCI
    - Travis CI
rationale: |
  All teams should move away from manually configured pipeliens. Treat your
  build pipeline as code, for example in a `Jenkinsfile`.
