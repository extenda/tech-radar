description: |
  [Google Cloudâ€™s operations suite](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations) (formerly Stackdriver) is designed
  to monitor, troubleshoot, and improve cloud infrastructure, software, and application performance.
  Efficiently build and run workloads, keeping applications performant and available.
rationale: |
  Operations suite gives us an easy way to monitor our workloads in GCP.
  We should consider using this as our first hand choice for observability tools.

  What we need to evaluate:
    * Ease of use
    * Feasability in terms of costs

  Operations also includes log collection and browsing. Any logging framework used by a cloud service must
  be interoperable with GCP Operations to ensure the logs can be collected, processed and analyzed.
