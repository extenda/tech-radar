  RightData is a self-service suite of applications that helps
  you achieve Data Quality Assurance, Data Integrity Audit and
  Continuous Data Quality Control with automated validation and
  reconciliation capabilities.
rationale: |
  Reason for this tool is a demand for something that can
  support Analytics and BI in a different way than traditional
  test tools for software development, which usually focus on
  end-point, front-end and code quality. This tool is focusing
  on data quality and relevant for testing implementation or
  modifications of data pipelines, transformations, reports,
  analytics or formulas/calculations.
  Examples of what the tool can automate:
  comparison of source and destination to ensure correctness of data.
  Check correctness of expected output from data pipelines given
  specific scenarios (ie. sales, stock adjustments etc).
  Comparison of data from previous version vs last version to ensure
  same result (ie. comparison of data for analytics or reports
  whenever any changes made).
  Verify same data result from different sources whenever they
  are expected to be the same.
  Sources or destinations can be cloud based databases, on
  premises databases, API's etc.
