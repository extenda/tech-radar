  [Genymotion](https://genymotion.com) is Android as a Service. It offers virtual
  android devices for testing in continuous integration.
rationale: |
  Genymotion is evaluated as a solution to support end-to-end UI tests on emulated
  devices in GitHub Actions.

  We are assessing the following:

    * If we can successfully use the virtual ADB connection on GitHub Actions
    * If tests are reliable and fast enough for CI/CD
    * If pricing is viable
    * If it's good enough to test on emulated devices
    * If we can ignore testing on iOS
