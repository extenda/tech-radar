description: |
  Micro frontends are a way, similar to micro services, to distribute and isolate development of
  business logic into smaller components and being able to present them in a customizable way.
rationale: |
  Micro frontends enables us to

   * Have teams develop their own isolated views and functions based on their needs without having
  to worry about fitting that into a larger eco system.
   * Build a platform where we can do upgrades on a component level with the customer instead of a
  complete rollout, enabling us to work more iteratively and have teams function autonomously.
   * Build completely customized customer solutions based on their functionality and license requirements.
