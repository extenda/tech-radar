  [Consumer-driven contract testing](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html)
  is a way to ensure that services (such as an API provider and a client) can communicate with each other.
  Without contract testing, the only way to know that services can communicate is by using
  expensive and brittle integration tests.
rationale: |
  In a microservice architecture we need a way to test the contracts between our
  collaborating services. Testing against live providers is slow, brittle and
  technically challenging. The alternative, with mocks and test doubles can lead
  to the danger of mocks becoming out-of-sync when the provider is changed.
  Consumer contract testing is a way to prevent this from happening.

  With consumer-driven contract testing, the consumer defines the API interactions
  and writes integration tests against this contract. This allows the consumer
  to build isolated, stable tests against the API contract.

  Next, the provider *must also* test against the same consumer contract verify
  that its output matches the consumer contract. This test allows the provider
  to discover any contract-breaking changes.
