  In short, [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) is a versioning scheme where
  the following rules govern how versions change:

  > Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
  > 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  > 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  > 3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
rationale: |
  The rationale for semantic versioning is that it provides a set of rules to
  communicate change in our software. Semantic versions helps the consumers of
  our software to evaluate the risk associated with an upgrade.

    * A MAJOR upgrade will most likely break things and additional work is likely required to mitigate this
    * A MINOR upgrade will introduce new functionality which may need to be configured, but nothing should break
    * A PATCH upgrade only contains bug fixes to existing features

  Extenda Retail's [product versioning policy](https://docs.extenda.se/display/DEV/Product+versioning+policy)
  dictates that all software projects must use semantic versioning.
