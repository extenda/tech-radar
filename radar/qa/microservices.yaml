description: |
  Microservices are a software development technique â€” a variant of the service-oriented architecture
  architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
  In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.
rationale: |
  Microservices as a distributed system of autonomous services enables us to

    * Move faster with independent deploys of services
    * Organize as autonomous teams that owns a service end-to-end
    * Choose the best technology to solve a business requirement
    * Scale each service independently

  It also comes with a lot of challenges releated to distributed systems, but overall, the benifits of
  microservices outweighs the drawbacks.
