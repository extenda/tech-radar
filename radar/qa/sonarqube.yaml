  SonarQube is a code quality analysis platform that given static code analysis and test code coverage rates the
  project against a quality gate. It supports a lot of languages, for example C, C++, C#, HTML, Java, JavaScript,
  TypeScript, XML.

  Code is analysed as part of the build pipeline. A local agent is used to analyze the project, the test results
  and coverage reports which are then published to SonarQube for further analysis.
rationale: |
  SonarQube is geared at "stopping the water leak". This means that the quality gates is focused on new code.
  This makes it achievable to pass the quality gate no matter how much technical debt exists in the code base.

  SonarQube gives us a single pane of glass for our code quality metrics. It allows us to inspect the overall quality
  and the quality within the leak period (new code). The leak period metrics makes SonarQube useful to gather lead
  measures for overall quality goals.

  SonarQube integrates in the IDE with the [SonarLint Plugin](https://www.sonarlint.org).

  **SonarQube comes in two flavors:**

    * In-house service based on SonarQube Community Edition. The service is free to use, but limited to a single branch
      and static analysis of pull requests.
    * SonarCloud SaaS solution with paid subscription plan. This service allows for full quality gate analysis of
      all branches and all pull requests. This service is free for open-source projects.

      SonarCloud is priced per lines of code it analyses. We can only analyze as many private projects as our quota
      allows, meaning we need to prioritize which projects to run on SonarCloud vs. in-house SonarQube.
