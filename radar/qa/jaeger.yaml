description: |
  [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), inspired by Dapper and OpenZipkin,
  is a distributed tracing system released as open source by Uber Technologies.
rationale: |
  We want a way to trace web and database traffic that is also compliant with OpenTracing.

  We prefer Google Cloud Operations (Stackdriver) over Jaeger and do not recommend it for services
  running on GCP.
