description: |
  Cucumber is a software tool used by computer programmers for testing other software.
  It runs automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development style.
  Central to the Cucumber BDD approach is its plain language parser called Gherkin.
rationale: |
  Scenario-based requirements are at the core of Extenda's development process.
  Features are described with Gherkin and tests are automated with Cucumber.

  Cucumber should be used for acceptance tests for all languages where it isn't
  an awkward fit. For the following platforms, _always_ favor Cucumber over
  alternatives such as for example _Spock_.
    * Java
    * Python
