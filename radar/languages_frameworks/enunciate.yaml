description: |
  Enunciate is a framework to create HTML documentation and client APIs for your
  REST service implemented with Java. The documentation is generated from source
  code and supports JAX-RS and Spring MVC to mention a few.
rationale: |
  Avoid Enunciate as it hasn't taken of, doesn't include any formal specification
  and is inferior in tooling compared to Open API (Swagger).
