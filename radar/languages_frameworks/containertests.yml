  Library for handling containerized test-databases with a simple API.
  Prerequisite: Docker must be installed locally. If the database image is not found,
  the library will download these while running the tests.
rationale:
  Enabling integration testing where we can run required services and infrastructure in containers.
  This will enable a stabile sandbox environment for every test run.
