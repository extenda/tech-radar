description: |
  Jersey 1.x is the reference implementation for JAX-RS 1. It is a framework
  to build RESTful services with Java.
rationale: |
  Jersey 1.x predates Servlet 3.0 and asynchrous request handling. Do not build
  REST services with Jersey and JAX-RS 1.x. Use other frameworks that supports
  asynchrous requests.
