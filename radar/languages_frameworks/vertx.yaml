  Eclipse Vert.x is a polyglot event-driven application framework that runs on the
  Java Virtual Machine.

  Vert.x contains several different components designed to make it easier for
  you to write compelling reactive applications in a range of different languages.
  It is a compelling approach to writing microservices!

  As of version 3.6.0, Vert.x exposes its API in Java, JavaScript, Groovy, Ruby,
  Scala, Kotlin and Ceylon.
rationale: |
  Vert.x is a very effective, highly performant framework where focus is on writing
  small isolated classes that communicates via a shared bus; EventBus.
  It has less "structure" than Spring Boot applications, in that it supplies
  a set of tools and you are free to use them in the way you like.

  It shares a lot of similarities with NodeJS; event loop, callbacks to name a few.

  The Golden Rule; _"Don't Block the Event Loop"_
