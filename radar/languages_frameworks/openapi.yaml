description: |
  The OpenAPI specification is a formal description of a RESTful web service
  which can be used to consume, document and visualize the API. Originally
  part of Swagger, but since 2016 separated to the OpenAPI initiative.
rationale: |
  Use OpenAPI specifications as the primary way to share REST API specifications
  both internally and externally. Swagger is the most known implementation and we
  recommend it is used for all REST APIs.
