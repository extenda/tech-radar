  Java is an object-oriented programming language that runs in a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
  Java compiles to bytecode which is then run on the JRE, allowing the same program to run on multiple platforms.

  There's many reasons we use Java at Extenda Retail.

    * Huge existing Java codebase and competence pool
    * Massive ecosystem and community
    * Great support for cloud
    * Runs efficiently on *nix and Docker

  When building new products, make sure to use the latest JDK available for
  your target deployment. For example, if you are building a microservice for
  SaaS, don't build it for Java 8, go for the latest Java release. But, if you
  are building a process that runs on a POS workstation, make sure to match
  the available JRE.

  For existing systems, it is important to start to upgrade to the next LTS
  release after Java 8 (at this time Java 11). We must make sure our products
  work on supported Java versions and don't lag behind on Java 8 after EOL.
