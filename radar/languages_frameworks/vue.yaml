description: |
  Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
rationale: |
  We currently use Vue as part of the NativeScript implementation in mobilepos-android.
  It's well suitable for single page apps and comes with most of the parts needed,
  and what's not included usually has strict recommendations.
