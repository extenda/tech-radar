description: |
  JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
  It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
rationale: |
  JS is the only currently widely supported language for web technologies and as such it's the only choice
  for building clients with HTML and CSS. The language has matured significantly the last few years and the evolution
  is continuing in a good pace.

  Because of it's loosely typed nature and plethora of misinformation online on how to write proper JS we have
  strict and unapologetic best practices for how JS projects should be structured and how the code should be written
  and quality assured.
