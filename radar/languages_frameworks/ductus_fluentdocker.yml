  FluentDocker is a library to interact with docker-machine, docker-compose and docker.
  It supports the docker for windows, docker for mac, docker machine, and native linux
  (however only limited tests on Linux and Mac).
rationale:
  Enabling integration testing where we can run required services and infrastructure in containers.
  This will enable a stabile sandbox environment for every test run.
