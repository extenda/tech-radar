description: |
  Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications using
  Typescript/JavaScript and other languages.
rationale: |
  Angular doesn't give us any benefits over current frameworks ([React](react.html) and [Vue](vue.html))
  being used. Angular projects should be written using TypeScript and for that to make sense all our
  JavaScript should use TypeScript to enable easy code reuse and competence sharing. We currently do not use
  TypeScript.
