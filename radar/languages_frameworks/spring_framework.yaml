  Spring Framework is an application framework and IoC container for Java.
  It integrates with most things Java and prominent features and frameworks include:
    - JPA (Hibernate)
    - Spring MVC
    - Spring Security
    - Spring Integration (Messaging)

  There's nothing wrong with Spring Framework. If you're already using Spring
  Framework in your product, please continue to do so. It will serve you well.
  But, if you are about to build a new microservice, consider something else
  than Spring Framework. There are lots of alternatives that are faster, smaller
  and quicker to develop.
