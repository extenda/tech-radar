description: |
  Apache Ant is a build tool designed to replace Make in early 2000. It is
  implemented in Java, configured with XML and primarily used to configure
  builds of Java applications. It allows for custom tasks to be implemented using a Java API.
rationale:
  There's no reason to use Apache Ant in modern CI build systems. Apache Ant has
  no native support for dependency management, which makes it really difficult
  to configure builds for modern applications. It is also missing out on existing
  integrations available in modern build tools such as Maven or Gradle.

  Products that ship Apache Ant as part of the distribution should work _activily_ to
  remove it. Apache Ant was never a general-purpose scripting language and is not
  ment to be available in production.
