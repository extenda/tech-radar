description: |
  The [Jenkins Build Farm](https://jenkins.extenda.se) is a container-based, elastic build farm maintained by
  Extenda Retail, running on AWS.
rationale: |
  Move to containerized, ephemeral build images. This ensures your build is reproducable
  and doesn't depend on previous states or manually maintained configuration or tooling.

  As long as your build depends on internal resources such as [Nexus](https://nexus.extenda.io)
  or [SonarQube](https://sonar.extenda.io) the Jenkins Build Farm is the
  best CI/CD platform that can be used.
