description: |
  AWS Lambdas are serverless functions managed by AWS and automatically scaled
  to handle varying load. They support multiple languages such as Java, Node.js
  and Python.
rationale: |
  Extenda Retail has chosen Google Cloud as the strategic, preferred cloud
  provider, hence new products should not be built with AWS Lambda if
  Google Cloud can be used.

  There is no requirement to convert existing solutions built on AWS Lambda.
