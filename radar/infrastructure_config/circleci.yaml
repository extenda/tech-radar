description: |
  CircleCI is an elastic SaaS CI/CD platform. It's based on dockerized ephemeral builds
  configured with `.circleci/config.yml` files following the [pipelines as code](pipelines_as_code.html) principles.
rationale: |
  CircleCI is evaulated as an alternative to the in-house Jenkins AWS. Using a
  service such as CircleCI would mean Extenda no longer need to manage and scale
  the Jenkins AWS build cluster.

  However, CircleCI is *not* compatible with `Jenkinsfile`s and currently can't
  access in-house resources such as the Nexus repository or SonarQube.
