  Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by
  Atlassian, for source code and development projects that use either Mercurial
  (since launch) or Git (since October 2011) revision control systems. Bitbucket
  offers both commercial plans and free accounts. It offers free accounts with
  an unlimited number of private repositories (which can have up to five users
  in the case of free accounts) as of September 2010. Bitbucket integrates with
  other Atlassian software like Jira, HipChat, Confluence and Bamboo. It is
  similar to GitHub, which primarily uses Git. Bitbucket has traditionally
  marketed its services to professional developers with private proprietary
  software code, especially since being acquired by Atlassian in 2010. In
  February 2017, Bitbucket announced it had reached 6 million developers and 1
  million teams on its platform.
  In April 2019 Atlassian announced that Bitbucket reached 10 million registered users and over 28 million repositories.

  We have standardized on GIT and Jira, so this is the repository chosen for
  Retail Suite. With its nice integration to Jira it offers the functionality
  required for developers. The pricing is USD 2.0 per month per developer.
