  Linux package management to find packages and resolve dependencies between RPM packages.
rationale: |
  Extenda Retail is aiming to reduce size of delivered packages. One way to achieve
  this is to utilize the support for tracking dependencies to other packages instead
  of bundling everything in one big package.

  For example, instead of delivering a big package for a POS workstation in a country,
  deliver a package that contains _only_ the country specific code and depends on the
  shared customizations and eventually the standard POS package.

  We have started storing RPM artifacts in an S3 YUM repository, but are still to
  utilize dependencies properly and allow customers to fetch them.
