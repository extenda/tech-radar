description: |
  Elasticsearch is a distributed, massively scalable document database. Coupled with
  Kibana, Beats and Logstash it is the most essential part of the
  [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack).

  Elasticsearch can reliably and securely take data from any source, in any format, then search,
  analyze, and visualize it in real time.
rationale: |
  Consider Elasticsearch when there's a need to search massive amounts of
  data, or a free-text search capability is needed. Consider Elasticsearch
  also for metrics, logging and tracing needs. Paired with [Kibana](data_management/kibana.yaml)
  Elasticsearch provides a powerful analytics and observability tool.

  ElasticSearch should be used as a managed service (SaaS) for cloud services in Google Cloud.
  Elastic provides this service as [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/).
