description: |
  Elasticsearch is a distributed, massivily scalable search engine.
rationale: |
  Consider Elasticsearch when there's a need to search massive amounts of
  data, for example in Retail Suite, Centraloffice, ASI or logging and tracing needs.

  Elasticsearch should be used as a managed service (SaaS) for cloud services. We must
  evaulate the licensing, operations and business case before we can adopt Elasticsearch.
