  [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) is a Google Cloud service and a unified
  AI platform that provides tooling for building, deploying, and scaling pre-trained and custom ML models.
rationale: |
  Vertex AI brings AutoML and AI Platform together into a unified API and user interface.
  AutoML is used to train models on image, tabular, text, and video datasets without writing code,
  while training in AI Platform lets us create custom models.
  With Vertex AI, both AutoML training and custom training are available options.
  Whichever option is chosen for training, models can be saved, deployed, and used for predictions with Vertex AI.

  Vertex AI provides functionality for managing all stages of Machine Learning workflows, including the following:
  - creating and managing datasets
  - training ML models on provided data
  - uploading and storing custom models
  - deploying models to an endpoint for serving predictions
  - sending prediction requests to endpoints
  - specifying a prediction traffic split in endpoints
  - managing models and endpoints

  The main benefit of using Vertex AI is that it significantly simplifies the process
  of building, serving, and scaling ML models on GCP.
