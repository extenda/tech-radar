description: |
  Microsoft Message Queuing or MSMQ is a message queue implementation developed by Microsoft
  and deployed in its Windows Server operating systems since Windows NT 4 and Windows 95.
  Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 also includes this component.
rationale: |
  MSQMQ is also not supporting .NET Core. We should look for better, cloud enabled alternatives for
  messaging between our services.

  MSMQ can still be used for legacy services and components on .NET Framework.
