description: |
  QlikView is an in-memory, business intelligence tool.
rationale: |
  QlikView is used at Extenda Retail for Customer Cloud's original analytics
  solution, still used by clients, deployed in Google Cloud. Future versions of
  Analytics are developed in the newer version Qlik Sense, and QlikView should
  be avoided.
