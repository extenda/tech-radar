description: |
  [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/index.html) is a tool to programmatically create,
  schedule, and monitor workflows.
rationale: |
  Use Airflow to create workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of tasks as a Python code.
  The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies.
  Airflow wrap and simplify the writing of Bash, SQL, Python scripts and also support GCP specific operations,
  like communication with Cloud Storage or BigQuery.
  The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production,
  monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.

  We are assessing the following:

  * Deployment and management of Airflow cluster components
  * Airflow cluster observability
  * Pricing for Cloud Composer (Google managed Airflow solution)
  * Integration with Google tools
  * How easy is write DAGs
  * How to test, deploy and control versions of DAGs
  * How DAGs are flexible(Dynamic DAG creation based on input)
  * DAG auto-healing, auto retries, fail notifications
  * UI functionality. DAG execution visualization
  * Authentification/Authorization granularity
  * Community adoption (number of contributors, releases frequency,
  popularity among commercial providers - GCP, AWS, Azur, etc)
