  Purpose with Looker is to simplify HiiRetail adoption of Actionable Insights,
  Analytics and Business Intelligence through data driven workflow, API's, SDK's,
  modern visualization, and integrated insights.

  Looker has a rich set of functionality including:
  - data-driven and action-based workflows and push notifications
  - embedding capabilities and API's
  - semantic layer and translation/localization of dialogs and labels
  - development of reports, dashboards, and widgets
  - scheduling
  - advanced and extensible visualization
  - security that can be integrated with Cloud IAM
  - ad-hoc capabilities
  - development and deployment process using GitHub

  Looker is backed by Google and recently has become a new GCP service available in Cloud Console.
  Being a native GCP solution for creating and managing reports with powerful modern visualization
  capabilities, Looker very good fits in with our cloud-native tech stack.

  After successfully evaluating all major Looker's functionality,
  we decided to adopt it and use it instead of Qlik Sense.
