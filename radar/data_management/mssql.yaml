description: |
  Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft.
  As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing
  and retrieving data as requested by other software applicationsâ€”which
  may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network.
rationale: |
  Persistent storage on the Microsoft Platform. Consider alternatives for new microservices.

  We're not recommending MSSQL for use in new products and cloud-native microservices.
  While it can be supported with Google's Cloud SQL, it comes with a premium price tag
  due to licensing costs and hardware requirements. It also has inferior tooling for
  infrastructure as code, making it harder to manage and maintain according to devops
  best practices.
