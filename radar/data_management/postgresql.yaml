    PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system
    that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that
    safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins
    of PostgreSQL date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the
    University of California at Berkeley and has more than 30 years of
    active development on the core platform.
