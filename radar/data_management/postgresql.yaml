  PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system
  that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that
  safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins
  of PostgreSQL date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the
  University of California at Berkeley and has more than 30 years of
  active development on the core platform.

  PostgreSQL is the preferred relational database for Hii Retail.
  If you need a relational database, especially with Cloud SQL, use PostgreSQL and no other alternatives.
  This is the only relational database that supports EKM and CMEK.
