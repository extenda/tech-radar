  [EverSQL](https://www.eversql.com/) provides AI based performance insights, SQL query rewrites, 
  indexing recommendations, cost reduction recommendations, ad-hoc SQL enhancements, slow query log 
  visualization and many more.
rationale: |
  We need a tool/extension that can be used for database tuning. Cloud SQL Query Insights doesnâ€™t 
  provide needed functionality. CPU/RAM and PLAN for query is not enough. The tool needs to clearly 
  suggest how to optimize the query plan, what indexes are missed etc. EverSQL meets the needs.
