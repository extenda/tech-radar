description: |
  [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow) is a serverless GCP service
  based on open-source project Apache Beam that provides a unified API for both stream and batch data processing.
rationale: |
  With Dataflow we get a processing engine as a fully-managed service
  that enables us to focus more on developing new functionality and delivering business value
  instead of spending time and resources on managing distributed software running on a cluster,
  which would be the case if we use Cloud Dataproc.

  Dataflow provides the following benefits:

  * Automated provisioning and management of processing resources.
  * Horizontal autoscaling of worker resources.
  * Reliable and consistent exactly-once processing.
  * Ability to create data pipelines for both batch and stream processing
  using the same unified model provided by one of the Apache Beam SDKs (Java, Python, Go).
