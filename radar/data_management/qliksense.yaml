  Qlik Sense is a business intelligence (BI) and visual analytics platform that
  supports dashboards, custom and embedded analytics, and self-service
  visualization.
  Qlik’s Associative Engine indexes and understands the relationships between all
  the values in your data. There are no pre-aggregated data models or predefined
  queries to limit discovery.
rationale: |
  Qlik Sense is based on the original product QlikView, running on Windows. Qlik
  Sense is in use at Extenda Retail in its analytics platform for Customer Cloud
  / Relevate. The solution is deployed on high performing Windows servers in the
  Google Cloud Platform.
  In April 2019 Qlik announced the general availablitity of Qlik Sense Enterprise
  for Kubernetes clusters using containers. This version would offer a much more
  scalable solution, to provide BI as a services for our clients.

  After successfully evaluating all major Looker's functionality,
  we decided to adopt it and use it instead of Qlik Sense.
