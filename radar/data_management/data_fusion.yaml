  [Data Fusion](https://cloud.google.com/data-fusion) is a fully-managed cloud-native code-free
  data integration service for quickly building and managing data pipelines on GCP.
  Data Fusion is built using open source project CDAP (https://cdap.io/),
    and this open core ensures data pipeline portability for users.
  Data Fusion offers pre-built transformations as well as the ability to create an internal library
  of custom connections and transformations that can be validated, shared, and reused across teams.
  It runs on top of ephemeral Cloud Dataproc clusters that are created, scaled, and deleted automatically.
rationale: |
  Data Fusion provides the following benefits:

  * Visual point-and-click interface enabling code-free development and deployment of EL/ELT/ETL data pipelines.
  * A library of 150+ preconfigured connectors and transformations.
