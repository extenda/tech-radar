  [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) dbt (data build tool) enables analytics engineers to
  transform data in their warehouses by simply writing select statements.
  dbt handles turning these select statements into tables and views.
rationale: |
  dbt is the T in ELT. It doesn’t extract or load data, but it’s extremely good at
  transforming data that’s already loaded into your warehouse. This “transform after load”
  architecture is becoming known as ELT (extract, load, transform).
