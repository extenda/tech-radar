  GitHub brings teams together to work through problems, move ideas forward,
  and learn from each other along the way. GitHub provides access control and several
  collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management,
  and wikis for every project.

  GitHub offers plans for enterprise, team, pro and free accounts which are commonly
  used to host open-source software projects. As of January 2019, GitHub offers
  unlimited private repositories to all plans, including free accounts.

  Using GitHub makes it easier to collaborate with colleagues and peers
  and look back at previous versions of your work. We have many integrations to github
  from other tools, e.g spinnaker, sonarcube, jenkins.
