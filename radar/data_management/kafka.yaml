  [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is an open-source stream-processing software platform
  developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java.
  The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput,
  low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.
rationale: |
  Kafka is a streaming platform available to be used when stream processing capabilities
  are needed and the output of the stream is required input to other services.
  To use Kafka for stream processing, the following conditions must be met:

    * Need for real-time event processing and streaming calculations
    * Kafka is not our messaging platform, if no stream processors or message
      ordering is needed, always use the general purpose message platform for
      both internal and external messaging. In cases where both producing and
      consuming services utilize Kafka Streams the consuming service can
      subscribe directly to the Kafka topic. If needed the messages shall also
      be published to pub-sub
    * Kafka is only eligible for use in Google Cloud Platform with Confluent Cloud

      Using Kafka requires a commercial agreement with Confluent Inc.
      The services and stream processors must also run in the Google Cloud Platform.
