  [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is an open-source stream-processing software platform
  developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java.
  The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput,
  low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.
rationale: |
  We consider Kafka a streaming platform to be used internally within a microservice domain
  when stream processing capabilities not supported by the general purpose messaging platform.
  To use Kafka in a service, the following conditions must be met:

    * Kafka is not our messaging platform, if no stream processors are needed,
      use the general purpose message platform
    * Use of Kafka is private to the clan's services. For all intents, consider
      Kafka the equal of a database
    * A business case can be built around the cost driven by using Kafka
    * Kafka topics are internal API and cannot be used to share messages with
      services with services maintained by other clans
    * Kafka is only eligible for use in Google Cloud Platform with Confluent Cloud

      Using Kafka requires a commercial agreement with Confluent Inc.
      The services and stream processors must also run in the Google Cloud Platform.
