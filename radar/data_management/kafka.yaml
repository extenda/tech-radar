  Kafka in [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/)
  is a fully managed, cloud-native Kafka service for connecting and processing all of your data,
  everywhere it's needed.
  Confluent's elastic scalability and virtually infinite storage simplifies real-time data movement across public
  and private clouds. You get out-of-the-box [connectors](https://www.confluent.io/hub/) to the most popular data
  sources/sinks in the Kafka ecosystem, in addition to a vast amount of other services.
  You get SQL-based stream processing, a governance suite for streaming data, 
  and more â€” all fully managed in the same cloud UI.
rationale: |
  Confluent Cloud provides Kafka and Kafka Streams as a streaming engine and processing platform available to be used
  when stream processing capabilities are needed and the output of the stream is required input to other services.
  To use Confluent Cloud for stream processing, the following conditions must be met:

    * Need for real-time event processing and streaming calculations
    * Need to source or sink data from/to multiple services without writing code
    * Kafka is not our messaging platform, if no stream processing or message
      ordering is needed, always use the general purpose message platform for
      both internal and external messaging. In cases where both producing and
      consuming services utilize Kafka Streams the consuming service can
      subscribe directly to the Kafka topic. If needed the messages shall also
      be published to pub-sub
    * Kafka is only eligible for use in Google Cloud Platform with Confluent Cloud
