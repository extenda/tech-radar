  [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is an open-source stream-processing software platform
  developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java.
  The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput,
  low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.
rationale:
  Kafka will cover several improvement needs in Retail Suite,
  and external systems communicating with Retail Suite.
  Its inherient scalability will allow us to target the Tier-1 and Tier-2 customers
  and support their traffic and computational needs in the daily operation of Retail Suite.
  The built in commit log can be regarded as the source-of-truth for several entities.
  The power of real-time streaming can enable Retail Suite to process vast amounts of data faster
  and more precise than today.
