  [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is an open-source stream-processing software platform
  developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java.
  The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput,
  low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.
rationale: |
  We consider Kafka a streaming platform to be used internally within a microservice domain.
  It can be used when stream processing capabilities not supported by the general purpose
  messaging platform are needed. To use Kafka in a service, the following conditions must be met:

    * Kafka is not our messaging platform, If no stream processors are needed, always use the
      general purpose message platform for both internal and external messaging
    * Use of Kafka is private to the clan's services. For all intents, consider
      Kafka the equal of a database and topics as private API only to be used internally
    * A business case must be built around the cost driven by using Kafka
    * Kafka is only eligible for use in Google Cloud Platform with Confluent Cloud

      Using Kafka requires a commercial agreement with Confluent Inc.
      The services and stream processors must also run in the Google Cloud Platform.
