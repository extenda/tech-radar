  [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html) is a visualization tool for Elasticsearch. 
  Kibana enables you to give shape to your data and navigate the Elastic Stack. With Kibana, you can:
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search, observe, and protect your data. From discovering documents to analyzing logs to 
      finding security vulnerabilities, Kibana is your portal for accessing these capabilities and more.</li>
      <li>Analyze your data. Search for hidden insights, visualize what you've found in charts, 
      gauges, maps, graphs, and more, and combine them in a dashboard</li>
      <li>Manage, monitor, and secure the Elastic Stack. Manage your data, monitor the health of your 
      Elastic Stack cluster, and control which users have access to which features</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
rationale: |
  Together with the other parts of the Elastic stack enables us to visualize any data 
  in dashboards or [Canvas](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/canvas.html). 
  It provides observability, visualization and alerts for our logs and system health 
  in a centralized location.
