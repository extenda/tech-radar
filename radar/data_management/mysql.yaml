description: |
  MySQL is a relational database by Oracle.
rationale: |
  MySQL is in use at Extenda Retail, for example to store reference data.
  Commercial use of MySQL requires a license agreement with Oracle and places
  restrictions on how MySQL is installed and used and which driver packages
  we can use to connect from our software.

  Future solutions should look for alternatives to MySQL.

    * Is a relational database the best fit?
    * If cloud, look for cloud native solutions - don't spin up MySQL
    * Thin clients can't depend on a local MySQL database
