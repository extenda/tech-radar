  Hazelcast is the worlds leading in-memory data grid, and is used as a database, cache or
  message broker. It offers simple scalability, partitioning and re-balancing. Functions
  seamlessly in Kubernetes, with discovery plugins for all major cloud providers.
rationale: |
  The great performance offered by Hazelcast is something we need to consider when building
  HiiRetail microservices. Also, being a default choice in Vert.x, a highly scalable, polyglot
  and performant toolkit, it is a great partner for the future HiiRetail services.
