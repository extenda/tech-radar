description: |
  [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner) is a fully managed, scalable,
  relational database service for regional and global application data.
  It is an enterprise-grade, globally-distributed and strongly consistent
  database service. It combines that benefits of relational database structures
  with the non-relational horizontal scale.
rationale: |
  Spanner's multi-regional capabilities makes it a good fit for global operations
  and multi-regional deployments. The entry-level pricing is comparable to the
  cost of a Cloud SQL database, hence many solutions can opt to use Spanner
  instead of Cloud SQL.

  Teams should start small and a minimal Spanner instance in a single region
  and scale out with more compute units and nodes when required.
