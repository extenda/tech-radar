  [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner) is a fully managed, scalable,
  relational database service for regional and global application data.
  It is an enterprise-grade, globally-distributed and strongly consistent
  database service. It combines that benefits of relational database structures
  with the non-relational horizontal scale.
rationale: |
  Spanner seems to be inline with our strategy of global operations.
  With its global consistency we could build systems for the future retailer.
  The downside of Spanner is its cost and we need to make sure we can justify it.

  What we need to assess:
    * Do we have clear business cases that could benefit from Spanner?
    * Does the functionality justify the costs?
