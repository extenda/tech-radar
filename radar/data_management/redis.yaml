description: |
  Redis is open source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache or message broker,
  offering built-in replication. Most standard operation has time complexity O(1).

  [Memorystore for Redis](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis) is available in Google Cloud.
rationale: |
  Consider Redis when there's need of data caching, fast lookup or session handling. Redis is also useful
  to share or distribute data between multiple running instances in an elastically scaling system.

  We recommend using Redis as managed service, mainly Memorystore for Redis. If a managed solution is
  available, always prefer it. If not possible, keep in mind that Redis Community Edition went through
  a license change and is now licensed by their [RSALv2 license](https://redis.io/legal/rsalv2-agreement/).
  It's not a recognized open source license, but permits usage without any copy-left. It's main objective
  is to take a license fee from cloud providers.
