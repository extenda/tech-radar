description: |
  Eclipse Vert.x is a polyglot event-driven application framework that runs on the
  Java Virtual Machine.

  Vert.x contains several different components designed to make it easier for
  you to write reactive applications in a range of different languages.
  It is a compelling approach to writing microservices!

  As of version 4.0.2, Vert.x exposes its API in Java, JavaScript, Groovy, Ruby,
  Scala and Kotlin.
rationale: |
  Vert.x is a very effective, highly performant framework where focus is on writing
  small isolated classes that communicates via a shared bus; EventBus.
  Being an unopinionated toolkit, the developer is free to do whatever fits the
  current requirement, with the set of tools Vert.x provide. A large set of modules
  brings even more functionality where needed.

  A powerful abstraction in Vert.x is that a single application or a whole cluster
  of applications is fully seamless -- everything is treated as a cluster.
  Verticles form a cluster within an application - applications form a cluster in a network.

  The (great) tools that Vert.x provide, and the extraordinary performance it shows
  makes it a highly suitable tool that we should consider building our microservices with.
