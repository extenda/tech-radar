description: |
  [Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/) is an open source
  object-relational mapping framework for ADO.NET. It was a part of .NET Framework,
  but since Entity framework version 6 it is separated from .NET framework.
rationale: |
  An easy to use ORM, good for small projects with low amount of data and performance needs.
  For bigger projects where speed is key, something else should be used.
