description: |
  [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org) is a tool to evolve your database schema continously.
rationale: |
  With liquibase, database schema migration is part of the everyday development. The schema is evolved using change sets
  that are executed by Liquibase to migrate the schema to the latest version. This means that the schema is continously
  migrated and no after-the-fact database migration scripts are ever needed.
