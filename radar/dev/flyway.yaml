description: |
  [Flyway Community Edition](https://www.flywaydb.org) is a tool to evolve your database schema continously.
rationale: |
  With Flyway, database schema migration is part of the everyday development. The schema is evolved with plain SQL
  change sets that are executed by Flyway. This means that the schema is continously
  migrated and no after-the-fact database migration scripts are ever needed.

  Flyway Community Edition is available under Apache-2.0 terms. There's also paid licenses that includes more
  advanced features and extended support. The features in Community Edition should be enough for what we want
  to use the tool for.
