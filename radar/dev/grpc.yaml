description: |
  [gRPC](https://grpc.io) is a remote procedure call framework that uses Protocol Buffers
  for data. It has a wide range of [supported languages](https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/)
  and has a simple c or java-like
  [service description language](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts/#service-definition).
rationale: |
  We see benefins in having a schema based message system for service to
  service communication both internally as well as to or from external systems.
  The communication is done over HTTP/2 so it opens up for bi-directional data transfer
  over a connection that is open for a longer time. It has support for pluggable
  authentication and load balancing so it is suited for microservice communication.
