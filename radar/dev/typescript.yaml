description: |
  TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
rationale: |
  Typescript has proven it's value in development, by enabling developers to write
  more strict and reliable code. With TS, it is safe to refactor code, because
  types will ensure, that your functions return what they suppose to.
  For Angular projects TypeScript is a requirement, this blip is for React projects
  using TypeScript.
