  Kotlin has experienced an accelerated rate of adoption and rapid growth of tooling support.
  Some of the reasons behind its popularity are its concise syntax, null safety,
  ease of transition from Java and interoperability with other JVM-based languages in general,
  and that it doubles as a great introductory language to functional programming.
  With JetBrains adding the ability to compile Kotlin to native binaries on multiple platforms,
  as well as transpile to JavaScript,
  we believe it has the potential of much wider use by the larger community of mobile and native application
  developers.
rationale:
  Modern alternative to Java, very productive and powerful language.
