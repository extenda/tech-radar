description: |
  Angular is a platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.
rationale: |
  Angular is a complete web application framework running on TypeScript. With
  a convention over configuration approach and TypeScript as a requirement it allows
  for an easier transition from backend to frontend and with a complete set
  of tooling it enables us to build large scale web applications.

  Formerly, we had both React and Angular in ADOPT, but we could not support both
  moving forward. Rallying around a singular frontend technology, we were better able
  to share knowledge, leverage reusable components, and support a consistent look and flow across
  the multitude of Hii Retail Service web frontends that we are developing.
