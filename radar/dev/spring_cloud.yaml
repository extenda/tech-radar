description: |
  Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems:
  e.g. configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing,
  micro-proxy, control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership election, distributed sessions, cluster state).
  Coordination of distributed systems leads to boiler plate patterns,
  and using Spring Cloud developers can quickly stand up services and applications that implement those patterns.
rationale: |
  Spring Cloud doesn't really work well with Kubernetes.
  Lots, if not all, of the services offered by Spring Cloud is natively handled by Kubernetes and friends.
  Using the native services of Kubernetes has proven much more stable and easy to use so we recommend them instead.
