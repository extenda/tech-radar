  Java Service Wrapper is a cross-platform solution to run java
  applications as services on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
rationale: |
  The Java Service Wrapper is licensed by Extenda Retail to use whenever
  there is a need to run a Java application as a service. This is an
  important feature for on-prem and data center services that must run as
  system services.

  With the current movement to containerized, cloud services, the need for
  a service wrapper will decline. In containers, the application simply runs
  as is and the wrapper is no longer needed.

  For legacy, or occational on-prem applications, the service wrapper may still
  prove useful. If a Java application must run as a service, use the wrapper,
  but only use it if containerization isn't an option.
