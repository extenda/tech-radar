description: |
  The [AsyncAPI initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com) is a specification for event driven APIs.
  It is inspired by OpenAPI and borrows concepts and schema modelling for some interoperability.
rationale: |
  [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com) is worth investigating as we miss a unified way to define
  and document our event driven APIs.

  What we need to assess:

    * Can we express our event driven APIs in a useful way?
    * Is the generated documentation good enough and in pair with what we can build from OpenAPI?
    * Can we publish the documentation in our developer portal?
    * Can we use OpenAPI specs for runtime validation or code generation?
