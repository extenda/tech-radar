  Micronaut is a new JVM framework for building microservices using Java, Kotlin or Groovy.
  It distinguishes itself through a small memory footprint and short startup time.
  It achieves these improvements by avoiding runtime reflection for DI and proxy generation,
  a common shortcoming of traditional frameworks,
  and instead uses a DI/AOP container which performs dependency injection at compile time.
  This makes it attractive not just for standard server-side microservices but also in the context of,
  for example, the Internet of Things, Android applications and serverless functions.
  Micronaut uses Netty and has first-class support for reactive programming.
  It also includes many features that make it cloud-native friendly such as service discovery
  and circuit breaking.
rationale:
  Powerful framework with very low runtime cost. Can run on a 10 MB heap using Java/Kotlin,
  and is very well suited for microservices.
