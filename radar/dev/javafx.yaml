description: |
  JavaFX is a desktop application platform by Oracle. It is intended to replace
  Swing and AWT for Java desktop applications.

  With JDK 11, Oracle will no longer bundle JavaFX with Java itself. Oracle
  hopes to accelerate community contributions via Open JDK by doing so. They
  will support JavaFX with Java 8 to a least 2022.
rationale: |
  Oracle indicates that Java FX won't get much attention going forward, hence we
  should consider other frameworks for new products.

  Existing products built on Java FX are not expected to take action to migrate
  away from Java FX. But Java desktop applications built on for example Swing
  should _not_ migrate to Java FX. Instead, consider swithing to a thin-client
  architecture.
