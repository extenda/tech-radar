description: |
  Xamarin.Forms (XF) is an open-source UI framework. XF allows developers to build Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS,
  and Windows applications from a single shared codebase.
rationale: |
  While XF is used for several apps within the company we now believe that it should be set on hold
  for any new development in favor for modern UI frameworks such as React Native or Flutter.
