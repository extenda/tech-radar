description: |
  The OpenAPI specification is a formal description of a RESTful web service
  which can be used to consume, document and visualize the API. Originally
  part of Swagger, but since 2016 separated to the OpenAPI initiative.
rationale: |
  Use OpenAPI specifications as the primary way to share REST API specifications
  both internally and externally.
