  Sketch is a graphics software for Mac used primarily for designing UI and UX of
  mobile apps and web. The software was built from the ground up for designing
  interactive interfaces. It creates live comps so that clients can preview what
  happens when they click, swipe, or tap your design on their desktop, laptop,
  tablet, or phone.

  The designs can be saved in the popular PNG, JPG, TIFF, WebP, etc., formats.
  Work created in Sketch is utilized by app engineers to design mobile apps and
  by web developers convert designs into websites

rationale: |
  [Sketch](www.sketch.com) will offer an easy way of designing UI and generating graphics
  for use in apps and front end projects. The process of design and asset generation is
  significantly faster the other graphic software, e.g Photoshop, through the use of
  symbols that can be styled and reused in all elements of a design.

  Sketch is rapidly becoming the go-to tool for web and app designers and adopting the
  software and workflow will give Extenda Retail an edge in frontend and app development.
