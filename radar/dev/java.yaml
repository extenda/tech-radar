description: |
  Java is an object-oriented programming language that runs in a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
  Java compiles to bytecode which is then run on the JRE, allowing the same program to run on multiple platforms.
rationale: |
  There's many reasons we use Java at Extenda Retail.

    * Huge existing Java codebase and competence pool
    * Massive ecosystem and community
    * Great support for cloud
    * Runs efficiently on *nix and Docker

  When building new products, make sure to use the latest JDK available for
  your target deployment. For example, if you are building a microservice for
  SaaS, don't build it for Java 8, go for the latest Java release. But, if you
  are building a process that runs on a POS workstation, make sure to match
  the available JRE.

  For existing systems, it is important to start to upgrade to the next LTS
  release after Java 8 (at this time Java 11). We must make sure our products
  work on supported Java versions and don't lag behind on Java 8 after EOL.
