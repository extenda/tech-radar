description: |
  Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
  Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
  Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable
  use of significant whitespace.  Its language constructs and object-oriented
  approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for
  small and large-scale projects.  Python is dynamically typed and
  garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
  including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented,
  and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included"
  language due to its comprehensive standard library.
rationale: |
  Python has long been known as a simple programming language to pick up,
  from a syntax point of view, anyway.   Python also has an active community
  with a vast selection of libraries and resources. The result? You have a
  programming platform that makes sense to use with emerging technologies
  like machine learning and data science. Python is popular because of
  it's Simplicity, Libraries, Multi-paradigm approach,
  Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), Community – there’s always someone to rely on!
