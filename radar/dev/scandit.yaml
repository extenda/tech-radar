  Scandit SDK is a cross-platform barcode scanner and data-capture solution.
  It is available for iOS, Android, Windows and Web and uses the camera to
  capture barcodes.

  Scandit also offers capabilities around augmented reality.
rationale: |
  Scandit SDK solves barcode scanning on all mobile platforms, allowing us to
  focus on our core business offerings instead of implementing and integrating
  barcode scanner technology ourselves. When compared to native Android and iOS
  barcode APIs, the Scandit SDK is more configurable and a lot faster.
