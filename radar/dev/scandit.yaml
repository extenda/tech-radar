  Scandit SDK is a cross-platform barcode scanner and data-capture solution.
  It is available for iOS, Android, Windows and Web and uses the camera to
  capture barcodes.

  Scandit also offers capabilities around augmented reality.

  Scandit SDK solves barcode scanning on all mobile platforms and web, allowing
  us to focus on our core business offerings instead of implementing and
  integrating barcode scanner technology ourselves. When compared to native
  Android and iOS barcode APIs, the Scandit SDK is more configurable and a lot
  faster.
