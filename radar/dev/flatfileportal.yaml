description: |
  An add-on for web-based applications to allow customers or internal users to upload spreadsheets of data.
  It pairs with SaaS dashboard and AI-assisted field match feature.
rationale: |
  HiiRetail needs rich UI capabilities, easy to embed and use, to allow users upload csv/xls data,
  fix validation issues on the go, and import the data to our services.
  This includes standing data, article data, etc.
  The software needs to:
    - Display the data in a readable way
    - Support fixing any errors in the loaded data
    - Support validation of the content according to rules specified by our AVRO formats
    - Support mapping fields to nested JSON objects
    - Possibility to add fields to dynamic information (e.g. AdditionalData AVRO definition)
