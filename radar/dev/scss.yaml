description: |
  Sass 3 introduces a new syntax known as SCSS which is fully compatible with the
  syntax of CSS, while still supporting the full power of Sass.
  This means that every valid CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS file with the same meaning.
rationale: |
  We want a well understood and well used method of writing, structuring and reusing our
  CSS, SCSS gives us this with minimal context switching for people who has written CSS before.

  As with JavaScript we enforce strict rules for how our SCSS and CSS is written, this helps
  keep quality high and code between projects consistent.
