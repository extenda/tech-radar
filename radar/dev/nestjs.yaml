description: |
  [_Nest_](https://nestjs.com/) (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient,
  scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript,
  is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript)
  and combines elements of OOP, FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).
  Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like Express (the default)
  and optionally can be configured to use Fastify as well!
rationale: |
  Nest provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows developers and teams
  to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications.
  The architecture is heavily inspired by Angular.
