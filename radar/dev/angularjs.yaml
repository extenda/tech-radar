  AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser.
  It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade/Pug and friends!) as your template language
  and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly.
rationale: |
  AngularJS is not being developed any more and is in LTS mode. No new project should use
  this framework for any reason.
