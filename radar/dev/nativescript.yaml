description: |
  Open source framework for building truly native mobile apps with Angular, Vue.js, TypeScript, or JavaScript.
rationale: |
  After evaulation we have decided to promote other solutions over NativeScript. We are holding NativeScript
  for the following reasons

    * Native integrations require NativeScript plugins, compared to For example React Native which
      supports direct native integrations
    * It was primarily used together with Vue and we have moved Vue to hold
