description: |
  Spring Boot 2 is an opioninated Spring library to create Spring application quickly.
  It comes with the ever-familiar dependency injection, autoconfiguration and loads
  of integrations and cloud ready functionality.

  With version 2, Spring Boot added lots of features related to cloud and
  microservices, such as improved actuators and reactive modules out-of-the-box.
rationale: |
  Spring Boot 2 is well-proven and very efficient for use with microservices if
  your team is familiar with Spring Framework. It will give you a running start
  and includes support for most things you'll need to write a microservice with
  good performance and great testability.

  While great for REST services, Spring Boot 2 is not the _fastest_ framework
  out there. If you're going for reactive paradigms, you may find that other
  frameworks such as [Vert.x](vertx.html) serves you better.
