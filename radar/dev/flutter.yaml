description: |
  Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively
  compiled applications for mobile from a single codebase.
rationale: |
  Flutter is engineered for high development velocity.
  This makes it perferct for building minimum viable products.

  Flutter provides its own set of widgets, which gives consistent look on
  different platforms. This also means, that developers don't have to
  touch native code - you can use the wide range of pre-existing
  widgets or create your own - the technology allows you to control
  every pixel on the screen.

  You can expect excellent performance. Flutter is designed to
  help developers easily achieve a constant 60fps.
  Flutter apps run via natively compiled code — no interpreters are involved.
  This means Flutter apps start quickly.
