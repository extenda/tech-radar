  Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively
  compiled applications for mobile from a single codebase.
rationale: |
  Flutter is engineered for high development velocity. That makes the framework perfect for
   building minimum viable products and considerably decreases time to market for full-blown applications.

  Flutter provides its own set of widgets, which gives a consistent look on different platforms. That
   also means that developers don't have to touch native code - you can use a wide range of pre-existing
   widgets or create your own, freeing up development time for innovation and business logic.

  You can expect excellent performance. Flutter is designed to help developers easily achieve a constant
   60fps. Flutter apps run via natively compiled code — no interpreters are involved. The UI will render
   directly on a native canvas via the Skia engine, instead of linking to native components.

  Flutter apps start quickly, perform well and produce a snappy and fast user experience.

  We are assessing the following.

  * If Github actions can build Flutter applications in a satisfactory way
  * If Github actions can distribute to iOS Appstore and Google Playstore
  * If UI testing can be automated on build
  * If Flutter integrates with Extendaretail code quality tools
  * Analytics and Crashlytics diagnostic capabilities
  * Feedback from go live with first customer

  Assessment results.

  We managed to build multiple pipelines for different tenants with Github actions. We deploy
   to test flight,firebase app tester, Apple App Store, and Google Play Store via the Fastlane action.
   Flutter is highly testable and we automated the testing process in our CI/CD pipeline.

  There is a limitation with the integration with Extendaretail's Sonarqube server because it's not
   extendable with plugins. We use code diagnostics and monitoring with Firebase Crashlytics
   and Firebase Analytics.

  We are going live shortly with our first tenant. We haven't received any feedback on apps
   in production.
