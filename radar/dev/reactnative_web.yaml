  "React Native for Web" makes it possible to run React Native components and APIs on the web using React DOM.
rationale:
  Allows having a React Native app that runs in the browser. Going forward, the trend of having a codebase
  that runs in the browser besides JS is just about to increase with the help of WebAssembly(Flutter Web, Blazor)
  even though RN Web isn't based on it.

  Of course, this is not for all types of apps but where we need to support more platforms.

  After evaluation we've decided to abandon React Native Web. We've moved in a different direction with our UIs.
  The community is also moving in the other direction, with React Native being generated from React Web.
