  [_Node.js_](https://nodejs.org/en/) is javascript on the server.
  It is asynchronous and event driven Javascript runtime
  built to be scalable and highly concurrent.
  Node.js is single-threaded and uses an event-loop for processing.
rationale: |
  Node.js is supported by all cloud provides and is essential in serverless and
  cloud native solutions. It is also a vital part of the front-end stack and a
  candidate for backend-for-frontend services.

  Node.js is particular good of solving these specific types of problems:
    * Non-blocking operations
    * Event-driven requests
    * Data-intensive process
    * I/O intensive systems
  The single threaded nature has it limitations
  and another language might be better to use if you want to solve the following:
    * Blocking operations
    * Processor intensive operations
    * Data calculations
