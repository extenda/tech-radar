description: |
  [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) is a data serialization system that has a binary format and
  with serialization speed compared to Protobuf and Thrift. The Avro schema can be declared using
  JSON or IDL, where the IDL is a more compact and easier to read definition, similar to Java and C.
  The schema is included in the message or if messages is stored in a file, contained in the file.
  With Avro's RPC functionality, the schema is exchanged once instead of in each message.
rationale: |
  Avro is a good fit for our big data storage since the schema is included and that it is supported in
  Google BigQuery and Cloud Storage.
