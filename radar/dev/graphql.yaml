  GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries
  with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description
  of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need
  and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful
  developer tools.
rationale: |
  As more and more of our services are broken down, more APIs will evolve, and the
  key here is "evolve" - it is very hard to create an API once, and stick to it.
  By making the API "dynamic" in the way that GraphQL works, we can have long-living
  APIs that spans multiple versions, yet still supports future extensions.

  It is also very effective to always fetch only the data you really need from a
  source of data, which can be of any type. DB, web endpoint or even a file..
  Also, as with e.g. REST, you need to fetch data in multiple requests to build
  one view. In GraphQL you can build an API that supports that view, and many more,
  all in "one endpoint".
