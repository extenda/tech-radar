description: |
  A Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot,
  crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards.
  As much processing as possible is done at build time,
  so your application will only contain the classes that are actually needed at runtime.
rationale:
  Quarkus let us build applications that are tailored for Cloud and Kubernetes.
  With a framework like this we can build fast and elastic services with ease.
