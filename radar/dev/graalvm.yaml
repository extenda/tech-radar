description: |
  GraalVM is a universal virtual machine for running applications written in
  JavaScript, JVM-based languages like Java, LLVM-based languages such as C and C++, and other languages.
  Native images compiled with GraalVM ahead-of-time improve
  the startup time and reduce the memory footprint of JVM-based applications.
rationale:
  Graal VM combined with a optimized framework such as Quarkus gives us containers optmizied for cloud.
  With sub-second startup times we can scale effectively and fast.
