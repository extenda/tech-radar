description: |
  React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React,
  letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.
rationale: |
  React Native enables cross platform development for iOS and Android, and with the Microsoft led
  initiative for Windows and macOS the code base can also be used for desktop binaries.

  React Native is in a mature state and is getting regular updates, the project is well
  maintained and roadmap and infrastructure plans are being well communicated by Facebook.

  TypeScript is fully supported.
