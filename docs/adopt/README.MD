### Create a slack channel (tech-radar maintainer)
Thereafter the maintainer creates a channel with the format #decision-XXX (for example for a frontend framework decision the channel could be “#decision-frontend-fw”). The name should capture a broader perspective than just the specific tool or framework in questions such that new ideas or solutions can come to light in the following discussion.

### Invite stakeholders and announce channel (tech-radar maintainer)
When the channel is created at least one stakeholder of each tribe should be invited. If unsure on which stakeholders to invite, invite the head of tribe. The channel creation should also be announced in #pd-announcements to let all developers take part.

### Discussion, time box 4 weeks (PD / Anyone)
When the channel has been created there should be a time for discussion. This discussion should be limited to a maximum of 4 weeks per tool.

If there is a consensus around the proposal the time could be reduced by the decision of the Radar maintainers. However only PD Senior Management can give approval of prolonged discussion.

This discussion should land in a proposal for how the organization should approach the technology/framework going forward, each different proposal should go to the next step for evaluation even if there is no majority around the proposal in question.

### Technology Suggestion (Technology backer)
The original PR should go directly to this step and the backers behind the proposal should write a business case for the technology. When someone in the discussion
proposes a new technology a technology suggestion (PR) should be made. If it is something new that has come up in the suggestion the document should hold the same information as the corresponding pull request.

### License & Contract Review and Impact Analysis “Business case” (PD Operations)

If the decision is to not adopt any tool the process should be closed, go to the "Pull request is rejected (Tech Radar maintainer)".
